<h1>GEMS-PI</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Initially this project was to help the G.E.M.S. (Goats Education Medicine Sustainability) Development Foundation non-profit (http://goatsfortheoldgoat.com/) in administering and configuring 115 android tablets for disconnected classroom use in South Sudan. It then expanded to building infrastructure for the delivery of educational media to the tablets and other classroom resources. My main contribution for the project was in assembling and augmenting some raspberry pi's with an image provided by World Possible (http://pi.worldpossible.org/) and additional storage, remote administration, and UPS capabilities.</p>

<h2>Tablet Configurations</h2>
<p>The Dell Venue 7, 8 inch tablet running the Android OS was procured on donation for the foundation. Mobile device providers were investigated, but preparation time and budget were heavily constrained. The warranty kept in place was another restriction, which ruled out jail breaking or installing a custom firmware. Products and services reviewed included:

<li>- blah</li></ul>
</p>

<p>The solution used was a combination of man power and the android play store. Apps could be delivered via the play store, or from the physical device. Configurations were required on the device itself. Total configuration time took less than a week using this method. The final app list is in the appendix. Above the </p>

<h2>Raspberry PI</h2>
<p>Initially lecture recordings and other educational resources were going to be provided by reach back to a medical university outside of the country over WiFi and WiMax. Technical and political constraints forced a different approach, mandating a disconnected configuration. The main parameters were low cost, media storage size, ease of administration, and power out survival.</p>

	Using a router with attached USB was the simplest approach. Scaling to more than a few users was a concern, although heavy testing was not performed only online review and recommendation.</li>
